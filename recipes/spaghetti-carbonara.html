    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and minced garlic. Once fragrant, add the diced pancetta. Cook until it's crispy.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the drained pasta to the skillet with pancetta. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour in the egg mixture, stirring rapidly to ensure the eggs don't scramble. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you get a creamy sauce consistency.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and more pepper if needed. Garnish with parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
