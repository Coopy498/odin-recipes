    <p>A timeless pizza recipe that highlights the simplicity and freshness of its ingredients. The Margherita pizza features a crispy crust, tangy tomato sauce, melted mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves. It's a tribute to the colors of the Italian flag and a testament to the idea that sometimes, less is more.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade) </li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (preferably homemade or a good quality store-bought one)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: a pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to its highest setting, usually around 475¬∞F (245¬∞C) to 500¬∞F (260¬∞C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Dough:</strong> On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness, typically about 1/4-inch thick for a crispy crust. If you're using store-bought dough, follow the instructions on the package.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Sauce:</strong> Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese It Up:</strong> Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the tomato sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated stone using a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet. If not using a stone, place the pizza on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Touches:</strong> Once out of the oven, scatter fresh basil leaves over the top. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and add red pepper flakes if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slice using a pizza cutter and serve immediately. Enjoy your classic Margherita pizza!</li>
